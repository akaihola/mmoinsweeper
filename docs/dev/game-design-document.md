# Game Design Document: Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper

## 1. Game Concept
Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper is a unique twist on the classic Minesweeper game. Players join a shared, infinite game board to uncover tiles and avoid mines in a persistent, ever-expanding world.

## 2. Core Gameplay Mechanics

### 2.1 Game Board
- The game board is infinite and shared among all players.
- The board consists of tiles that can be either empty or contain a mine.
- Empty tiles display the number of adjacent mines (1-8) or are blank if no adjacent mines.

### 2.2 Player Actions
- Players can uncover tiles that are diagonally or orthogonally adjacent to tiles they've already uncovered.
- Players cannot uncover tiles that have been revealed by other players.

### 2.3 Joining the Game
- New players can join the game at any time.
- Each new player is assigned a unique, internal running player number.
- New players start at a random, safe location on the board:
  - The starting tile and its eight adjacent tiles must be free of mines.
  - The starting position should be relatively close to recent player activity.
  - The starting position is automatically uncovered to give the player a safe area to begin exploring.

### 2.4 Player Identification
- The game client assigns different colors to players.
- Colors are chosen to ensure easy distinction between players in close proximity, the all-time top player, and the three best currently active players.

### 2.5 Losing Conditions
- A player loses if they uncover a mine.
- A player also loses if they have no more adjacent tiles to uncover.
- After losing, a player's uncovered tiles remain on the board.
- To continue playing, a lost player must re-join as a new player.

### 2.6 Game Continuity
- The game never ends.
- Players can join, play, lose, and re-join indefinitely.
- The game board persists and expands as players uncover more tiles.

## 3. User Interface

### 3.1 Main Game Screen
- Displays the infinite game board, initially centered on the randomly chosen starting position.
- Shows uncovered tiles with numbers indicating adjacent mines.
- Represents different players with unique colors.

### 3.2 Player Information
- Shows the color, leaderboard position (always "1.") and score (number of tiles uncovered) of the all-time top player.
- Shows the color, leaderboard position and score of the best currently active player.
- Shows the player's color, current leaderboard position and score.

### 3.3 Controls
- Tap or click to uncover a tile.
- Pinch-to-zoom or scroll wheel to adjust view scale.
- Drag to pan the view.

## 4. Technical Considerations

### 4.1 Multiplayer Synchronization
- Real-time updates of tile states across all connected clients.
- Efficient data transfer to handle potentially large numbers of simultaneous players.

### 4.2 Infinite Board Generation
- Procedural generation of the game board as players explore new areas.
- Consistent mine placement algorithm to ensure the same board state for all players.

### 4.3 Performance Optimization
- Efficient rendering of the visible portion of the infinite board.
- Load balancing to handle multiple players in different areas of the board.

This GDD provides a foundation for developing the Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper game. As development progresses, this document can be expanded and refined to include more detailed specifications and additional features.
