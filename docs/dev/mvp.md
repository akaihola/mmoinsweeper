# Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper MVP

## MVP Requirements

1. Large pre-generated game board (1000x1000 tiles)
2. Basic multiplayer functionality:
   - Join game
   - See other players' actions in real-time
3. Tile uncovering mechanic
4. Simple player identification (color-based)
5. Real-time updates of game state
6. Basic UI showing the game board and player score

## Implementation Plan (4 hours)

1. Server setup (45 minutes):
   - Initialize Rust project with WebSocket support
   - Implement basic game state structure (board, players)

2. Game logic (60 minutes):
   - Create function to generate large pre-filled board
   - Implement tile uncovering logic
   - Add player join and basic color assignment

3. WebSocket communication (45 minutes):
   - Set up WebSocket server
   - Implement message handling for player actions and state updates

4. Client-side setup (30 minutes):
   - Create HTML structure and basic CSS
   - Set up JavaScript WebSocket client

5. Client-side game rendering (60 minutes):
   - Implement canvas-based game board rendering
   - Add pan and zoom functionality

6. Game interactions (30 minutes):
   - Implement click-to-uncover functionality
   - Add real-time updates from other players

7. Final touches and testing (30 minutes):
   - Add basic UI elements (score, player color)
   - Perform basic functionality testing
   - Fix critical bugs if any

## Potential Challenges

- Efficiently rendering large game board on the client-side
- Ensuring smooth real-time updates with multiple players
- Balancing between game functionality and development time constraints
