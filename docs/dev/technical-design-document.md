# Technical Design Document: Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper

## 1. System Architecture Overview

The Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper game consists of two main components:
1. Server: Implemented in Rust
2. Client: Implemented in pure web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Communication between the server and client will use a simple, efficient protocol over WebSocket connections.

## 2. Server Architecture

### 2.1 Technology Stack
- Language: Rust
- WebSocket Library: tokio-tungstenite
- Database Abstraction: trait-based approach for flexibility

### 2.2 Core Components

#### 2.2.1 WebSocket Server
- Handles client connections and message routing
- Manages player sessions

#### 2.2.2 Game State Manager
- Maintains the current state of the game
- Processes player actions
- Generates and manages the infinite minefield

#### 2.2.3 Database Abstraction Layer
- Provides an interface for data storage and retrieval
- Allows for easy switching between different storage backends

#### 2.2.4 Player Manager
- Handles player join/rejoin logic
- Manages player status and information

### 2.3 Data Models

#### 2.3.1 Minefield
- Random seed (u64): Used to generate the minefield

#### 2.3.2 Uncovered Tile
- Position: (i64, i64)
- Timestamp: u32
- Player number: u32

#### 2.3.3 Player
- Player number: u32
- Join timestamp: u32
- Status: enum (Active, Lost)
- Last activity timestamp: u32
- Last uncovered tile position: (i64, i64)
- Tiles uncovered count: u32

### 2.4 Algorithms

#### 2.4.1 Minefield Generation
- Use the random seed to deterministically generate mine positions
- Implement a chunking system for efficient infinite board management

#### 2.4.2 Player Positioning
- Implement an algorithm to find a safe starting position for new players
- Consider recent player activity when selecting the position

### 2.5 Scalability Considerations
- Design the first version so a single server scales as far as possible

#### 2.5.1 Scalability Future Considerations
- Keep options open for scaling in the future, for example:
  - Implement a sharding system for the game world
  - Use a distributed database for storing game state
  - Implement load balancing for handling multiple game servers

## 3. Client Architecture

### 3.1 Technology Stack
- HTML5 (for structure)
- CSS3 (for styling)
- JavaScript (ES6+, for logic and interactivity)
- Canvas API (for rendering the game board)

### 3.2 Core Components

#### 3.2.1 Game Board Renderer
- Efficiently renders the visible portion of the infinite board
- Implements zooming and panning functionality

#### 3.2.2 Input Handler
- Manages user interactions (clicks, touches, zooming, panning)
- Translates user actions into game commands

#### 3.2.3 WebSocket Client
- Manages real-time communication with the server
- Handles connection status and reconnection attempts

#### 3.2.4 Game State Manager
- Maintains the local game state
- Synchronizes with server updates

#### 3.2.5 UI Manager
- Handles the user interface elements (score display, status messages, etc.)
- Manages responsive layout for different screen sizes

### 3.3 Optimization Techniques

#### 3.3.1 Tile Rendering
- Implement tile caching to reduce redraw operations
- Use offscreen canvas for improved performance

#### 3.3.2 Data Management
- Implement efficient data structures for quick tile lookup and updates
- Use a quadtree or similar spatial data structure for managing visible tiles

### 3.4 Mobile Considerations
- Implement touch controls for mobile devices
- Use responsive design principles for adaptable UI
- Consider using a PWA (Progressive Web App) approach for easy mobile deployment

## 4. Communication Protocol

### 4.1 WebSocket Messages
- Use JSON for message formatting
- Implement message compression for reduced data transfer

### 4.2 Message Types
1. Player Join
2. Tile Uncover Request
3. Tile Update
4. Player Status Update
5. Error Message

### 4.3 Real-time Updates
- Implement efficient delta updates to minimize data transfer
- Use binary protocols for time-critical data (e.g., player positions)

## 5. Security Considerations

### 5.1 Server-side Validation
- Validate all client actions server-side to prevent cheating
- Implement rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks

### 5.2 Authentication
- Implement a simple authentication system for persistent player identities

## 6. Testing Strategy

### 6.1 Server Testing
- Unit tests for core game logic
- Integration tests for database abstraction layer
- Load testing for concurrent player handling

### 6.2 Client Testing
- Unit tests for game state management and rendering logic
- Cross-browser testing
- Performance testing on various devices

## 7. Deployment and Monitoring

### 7.1 Server Deployment
- Use containerization (e.g., Docker) for easy deployment and scaling
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

### 7.2 Client Deployment
- Use a CDN for serving static assets
- Implement versioning for cache management

### 7.3 Monitoring and Logging
- Implement comprehensive logging on the server
- Use application performance monitoring (APM) tools for real-time insights
- Set up alerts for critical issues

This Technical Design Document provides a solid foundation for implementing the Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper game. It covers the key aspects of both server and client architecture while considering scalability, performance, and future extensibility.
