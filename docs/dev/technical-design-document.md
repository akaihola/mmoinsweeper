# Technical Design Document: Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper

## 1. System Architecture Overview

The Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper game consists of two main components:
- [x] 1. Server: Implemented in Rust
- [x] 2. Client: Implemented in pure web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Communication between the server and client will use a simple, efficient protocol over WebSocket connections.

## 2. Server Architecture

### 2.1 Technology Stack
- [x] Language: Rust
- [x] WebSocket Library: tokio-tungstenite
- [ ] Database Abstraction: trait-based approach for flexibility

### 2.2 Core Components

#### 2.2.1 WebSocket Server
- [x] Handles client connections and message routing
- [x] Manages player sessions

#### 2.2.2 Game State Manager
- [x] Maintains the current state of the game
- [x] Processes player actions
- [x] Generates and manages the infinite minefield

#### 2.2.3 Database Abstraction Layer
- [ ] Provides an interface for data storage and retrieval
- [ ] Allows for easy switching between different storage backends

#### 2.2.4 Player Manager
- [x] Handles player join logic
- [ ] Handles player rejoin logic
- [x] Manages player status and information

### 2.3 Data Models

#### 2.3.1 Minefield
- [x] Game epoch (u32): Used as the random seed to generate the minefield
- [x] Next player number (u32): Used for assigning player numbers
- [x] History of uncovered tiles (VecDeque<(u64, u64)>): Used for finding safe starting positions

#### 2.3.2 Uncovered Tile
- [x] Position: (i64, i64)
- [x] Timestamp: u32
- [x] Player number: u32

#### 2.3.3 Player
- [x] Player number: u32
- [x] Token for Websocket connection: String
- [x] Join timestamp: u32
- [ ] Status: enum (Active, Lost)
- [x] Color: String
- [x] Tiles uncovered count: u32
- [ ] Last activity timestamp: u32
- [ ] Last uncovered tile position: (i64, i64)
- [x] Channel for sending information to the client: UnboundedSender
- [x] Current visible area: ((i64, i64), (i64, i64))

### 2.4 Algorithms

#### 2.4.1 Minefield Generation
- [x] Use the random seed to deterministically generate mine positions
- [ ] Implement a chunking system for efficient infinite board management

#### 2.4.2 Player Positioning
- [ ] Implement an algorithm to find a safe starting position for new players (PoC done)
- [x] Consider recent player activity when selecting the position

### 2.5 Scalability Considerations
- [x] Design the first version so a single server scales as far as possible

#### 2.5.1 Scalability Future Considerations
- Keep options open for scaling in the future, for example:
  - [ ] Implement a sharding system for the game world
  - [ ] Use a distributed database for storing game state
  - [ ] Implement load balancing for handling multiple game servers

## 3. Client Architecture

### 3.1 Technology Stack
- [x] HTML5 (for structure)
- [x] CSS3 (for styling)
- [x] JavaScript (ES6+, for logic and interactivity)
- [x] Canvas API (for rendering the game board)

### 3.2 Core Components

#### 3.2.1 Game Board Renderer
- [ ] Efficiently renders the visible portion of the infinite board (PoC done)
- [ ] Implements zooming functionality
- [x] Implements panning functionality

#### 3.2.2 Input Handler
- Manages user interactions:
  - [x] clicks
  - [x] touches
  - [ ] zooming
  - [x] panning
- [x] Translates user actions into game commands

#### 3.2.3 WebSocket Client
- [x] Manages real-time communication with the server
- [ ] Handles connection status and reconnection attempts

#### 3.2.4 Game State Manager
- [x] Maintains the local game state
- [x] Synchronizes with server updates

#### 3.2.5 UI Manager
- Handles the user interface elements:
  - [ ] score display (in progress)
  - [ ] status messages
- [ ] Manages responsive layout for different screen sizes

### 3.3 Optimization Techniques

#### 3.3.1 Tile Rendering
- [ ] Implement tile caching to reduce redraw operations
- [ ] Use offscreen canvas for improved performance

#### 3.3.2 Data Management
- [ ] Implement efficient data structures for quick tile lookup and updates
- [ ] Use a quadtree or similar spatial data structure for managing visible tiles

### 3.4 Mobile Considerations
- [x] Implement touch controls for mobile devices
- [ ] Use responsive design principles for adaptable UI
- [ ] Consider using a PWA (Progressive Web App) approach for easy mobile deployment

## 4. Communication Protocol

### 4.1 WebSocket Messages
- [x] Use JSON for message formatting
- [ ] Implement message compression for reduced data transfer

### 4.2 Message Types
1. [x] Player Join
2. [x] Tile Uncover Request
3. [x] Tile Update
4. [x] Player Status Update
5. [ ] Error Message

### 4.3 Real-time Updates
- [ ] Implement efficient delta updates to minimize data transfer
- [ ] Use binary protocols for time-critical data (e.g., player positions)

## 5. Security Considerations

### 5.1 Server-side Validation
- [ ] Validate all client actions server-side to prevent cheating
- [ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks

### 5.2 Authentication
- [x] Implement a simple authentication system for persistent player identities (token)

## 6. Testing Strategy

### 6.1 Server Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for core game logic
- [ ] Integration tests for database abstraction layer
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent player handling

### 6.2 Client Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for game state management and rendering logic
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Performance testing on various devices

## 7. Deployment and Monitoring

### 7.1 Server Deployment
- [ ] Use containerization (e.g., Docker) for easy deployment and scaling
- [ ] Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

### 7.2 Client Deployment
- [ ] Use a CDN for serving static assets
- [ ] Implement versioning for cache management

### 7.3 Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging on the server
- [ ] Use application performance monitoring (APM) tools for real-time insights
- [ ] Set up alerts for critical issues

This Technical Design Document provides a solid foundation for implementing the Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper game. It covers the key aspects of both server and client architecture while considering scalability, performance, and future extensibility.
