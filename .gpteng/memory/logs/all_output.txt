================================ System Message ================================

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

# Game Design Document: Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper

## 1. Game Concept
Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper is a unique twist on the classic Minesweeper game. Players join a shared, infinite game board to uncover tiles and avoid mines in a persistent, ever-expanding world.

## 2. Core Gameplay Mechanics

### 2.1 Game Board
- The game board is infinite and shared among all players.
- The board consists of tiles that can be either empty or contain a mine.
- Empty tiles display the number of adjacent mines (1-8) or are blank if no adjacent mines.

### 2.2 Player Actions
- Players can uncover tiles that are diagonally or orthogonally adjacent to tiles they've already uncovered.
- Players cannot uncover tiles that have been revealed by other players.

### 2.3 Joining the Game
- New players can join the game at any time.
- Each new player is assigned a unique, internal running player number.
- New players start at a random, safe location on the board:
  - The starting tile and its eight adjacent tiles must be free of mines.
  - The starting position should be relatively close to recent player activity.
  - The starting position is automatically uncovered to give the player a safe area to begin exploring.

### 2.4 Player Identification
- The game client assigns different colors to players.
- Colors are chosen to ensure easy distinction between players in close proximity, the all-time top player, and the three best currently active players.

### 2.5 Losing Conditions
- A player loses if they uncover a mine.
- A player also loses if they have no more adjacent tiles to uncover.
- After losing, a player's uncovered tiles remain on the board.
- To continue playing, a lost player must re-join as a new player.

### 2.6 Game Continuity
- The game never ends.
- Players can join, play, lose, and re-join indefinitely.
- The game board persists and expands as players uncover more tiles.

## 3. User Interface

### 3.1 Main Game Screen
- Displays the infinite game board, initially centered on the randomly chosen starting position.
- Shows uncovered tiles with numbers indicating adjacent mines.
- Represents different players with unique colors.

### 3.2 Player Information
- Shows the color, leaderboard position (always "1.") and score (number of tiles uncovered) of the all-time top player.
- Shows the color, leaderboard position and score of the best currently active player.
- Shows the player's color, current leaderboard position and score.

### 3.3 Controls
- Tap or click to uncover a tile.
- Pinch-to-zoom or scroll wheel to adjust view scale.
- Drag to pan the view.

## 4. Technical Considerations

### 4.1 Multiplayer Synchronization
- Real-time updates of tile states across all connected clients.
- Efficient data transfer to handle potentially large numbers of simultaneous players.

### 4.2 Infinite Board Generation
- Procedural generation of the game board as players explore new areas.
- Consistent mine placement algorithm to ensure the same board state for all players.

### 4.3 Performance Optimization
- Efficient rendering of the visible portion of the infinite board.
- Load balancing to handle multiple players in different areas of the board.

This GDD provides a foundation for developing the Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper game. As development progresses, this document can be expanded and refined to include more detailed specifications and additional features.


# Technical Design Document: Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper

## 1. System Architecture Overview

The Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper game consists of two main components:
1. Server: Implemented in Rust

    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 5px;
}
```

## 5. Client-side Game Rendering

### Implement Canvas-based Game Board Rendering

public/main.js
```
const canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
canvas.height = window.innerHeight;

let gameState = {
    tiles: [],
    players: [],
};

const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

ws.onopen = () => {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({ player_id: null, action_type: 'join', x: 0, y: 0 }));
};

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    gameState = JSON.parse(event.data);
    renderGame();
};

canvas.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    const x = Math.floor(event.clientX / 20);
    const y = Math.floor(event.clientY / 20);
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({ player_id: 1, action_type: 'uncover', x, y }));
});

function renderGame() {
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    gameState.tiles.forEach(tile => {
        ctx.fillStyle = tile.is_mine ? 'red' : 'white';
        ctx.fillRect(tile.x * 20, tile.y * 20, 20, 20);
        if (!tile.is_mine && tile.adjacent_mines > 0) {
            ctx.fillStyle = 'black';
            ctx.fillText(tile.adjacent_mines, tile.x * 20 + 5, tile.y * 20 + 15);
        }
    });
    gameState.players.forEach(player => {
        ctx.fillStyle = player.color;
        ctx.fillText(`Player ${player.id}: ${player.score}`, 10, 20 * player.id);
    });
}
```

## 6. Game Interactions

### Implement Click-to-Uncover Functionality and Real-time Updates

This is already covered in the `public/main.js` file above.

## 7. Final Touches and Testing

### Add Basic UI Elements and Perform Basic Functionality Testing

This is already covered in the `public/index.html` and `public/main.js` files above.

This concludes a fully working implementation.
