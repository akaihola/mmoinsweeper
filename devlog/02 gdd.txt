USER:

Write a minimal Game Design Document based on the following notes:
1. The game is an Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper.
2. Players can join a shared game board and uncover tiles to find mines.
3. A new player can join an existing game at any time.
4. A new player is assigned an internal running player number.
5. A new player is positioned at a random non-mine tile whose eight adjacent tiles are also free of mines. The starting position must not be too far from recent activity of other players.
6. The game client assigns different colors to different players, ensuring that players active near each other are easily distinguishable.
7. Players can only uncover tiles that have not been uncovered by other players.
8. A player can only uncover tiles that are diagonally or orthogonally adjacent to tiles already uncovered by the same player.
9. A player loses if they uncover a mine or if there aren't any more tiles to uncover adjacent to tiles they've already uncovered. All uncovered tiles remain as they are after the player has left.
10. After losing, a player can only continue by re-joining the game as a new player.
11. The game never ends, and players can keep joining, playing, losing and re-joining indefinitely.


ASSISTANT:

Certainly! I'll create a minimal Game Design Document (GDD) based on the notes you've provided for the Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper game. This document will serve as a foundation for the development process.





# Game Design Document: Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper

## 1. Game Concept
Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper is a unique twist on the classic Minesweeper game. Players join a shared, infinite game board to uncover tiles and avoid mines in a persistent, ever-expanding world.

## 2. Core Gameplay Mechanics

### 2.1 Game Board
- The game board is infinite and shared among all players.
- The board consists of tiles that can be either empty or contain a mine.
- Empty tiles display the number of adjacent mines (0-8).

### 2.2 Player Actions
- Players can uncover tiles that are diagonally or orthogonally adjacent to tiles they've already uncovered.
- Players cannot uncover tiles that have been revealed by other players.

### 2.3 Joining the Game
- New players can join the game at any time.
- Each new player is assigned a unique, internal running player number.
- New players start at a random, safe location on the board:
  - The starting tile and its eight adjacent tiles must be free of mines.
  - The starting position should be relatively close to recent player activity.

### 2.4 Player Identification
- The game client assigns different colors to players.
- Colors are chosen to ensure easy distinction between players in close proximity.

### 2.5 Losing Conditions
- A player loses if they uncover a mine.
- A player also loses if they have no more adjacent tiles to uncover.
- After losing, a player's uncovered tiles remain on the board.
- To continue playing, a lost player must re-join as a new player.

### 2.6 Game Continuity
- The game never ends.
- Players can join, play, lose, and re-join indefinitely.
- The game board persists and expands as players uncover more tiles.

## 3. User Interface

### 3.1 Main Game Screen
- Displays the infinite game board, centered on the player's current position.
- Shows uncovered tiles with numbers indicating adjacent mines.
- Represents different players with unique colors.

### 3.2 Player Information
- Displays the player's assigned color.
- Shows the player's current score (number of tiles uncovered).

### 3.3 Controls
- Tap or click to uncover a tile.
- Pinch-to-zoom or scroll wheel to adjust view scale.
- Drag to pan the view.

## 4. Technical Considerations

### 4.1 Multiplayer Synchronization
- Real-time updates of tile states across all connected clients.
- Efficient data transfer to handle potentially large numbers of simultaneous players.

### 4.2 Infinite Board Generation
- Procedural generation of the game board as players explore new areas.
- Consistent mine placement algorithm to ensure the same board state for all players.

### 4.3 Performance Optimization
- Efficient rendering of the visible portion of the infinite board.
- Load balancing to handle multiple players in different areas of the board.

## 5. Monetization (Optional)

### 5.1 Cosmetic Items
- Custom colors or patterns for uncovered tiles.
- Special effects when uncovering tiles.

### 5.2 Gameplay Enhancements
- "Safe start" power-up: Guarantees a larger safe area when joining.
- "Reveal" power-up: Shows the contents of adjacent tiles without risk.

## 6. Future Expansions

### 6.1 Social Features
- In-game chat system.
- Friend lists and private games.

### 6.2 Competitive Modes
- Timed challenges in specific board areas.
- Leaderboards for most tiles uncovered without losing.

This GDD provides a foundation for developing the Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper game. As development progresses, this document can be expanded and refined to include more detailed specifications and additional features.


This Game Design Document (GDD) outlines the core concepts and mechanics of the Infinite Multi-Player Online Minesweeper game. It covers all the key points you provided while organizing them into a structured format that will guide the development process.

The document is intentionally kept minimal to focus on the essential elements of the game. It provides a clear overview of the gameplay, player interactions, and technical considerations without going into excessive detail. This approach allows for flexibility in implementation while ensuring that all crucial aspects of the game design are addressed.

As the project progresses, you may want to expand on certain sections, such as:

1. More detailed UI/UX wireframes
2. Specific algorithms for board generation and mine placement
3. Network protocol specifications for real-time updates
4. Detailed player onboarding process
5. Metrics for positioning new players near "recent activity"

Remember that this GDD is a living document. Feel free to update and refine it as you develop the game and gain new insights or face unexpected challenges. The goal is to maintain a clear vision for the game while allowing room for iteration and improvement.
