The leaderboard is currenly drawn into the Canvas.
Change it to an HTML table. The table should have the following columns:
- Rank (by current sorting order)
- Name
- Score (total tiles opened)
- Time (total time since joining the game)
- TPH (tiles per hour)

The table should be sorted by the Score column (ascending) by default.
The table should only show the following players:
- this player (the player who is currently logged in on this browser)
- the player who is ranked directly above this player
- the player who is ranked directly below this player
- the top player
- each player whose uncovered tiles are currently visible on the screen

Sorting can be changed to be based on either the Score or the TPH column (descending)
by clicking on the respective column header.

The table should be updated whenever a message with a change to player data is received.

The table should be initially hidden beyond the left edge of the screen,
with a small handle visible in the top left corner
When the clicks or touches the handle to the right,
the table visibility should toggle by sliding into view or out of view.
